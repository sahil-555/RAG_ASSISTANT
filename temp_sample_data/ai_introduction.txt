Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create 
            intelligent machines that work and react like humans. Some of the activities 
            computers with artificial intelligence are designed for include speech recognition, 
            learning, planning, and problem solving.
            
            AI has been around for decades, but recent advances in machine learning and 
            deep learning have made it more powerful and accessible than ever before.
