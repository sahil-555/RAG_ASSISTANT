Machine Learning is a subset of AI that provides systems the ability to automatically 
            learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning 
            focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to 
            learn for themselves.
            
            There are three main types of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised 
            learning, and reinforcement learning.
