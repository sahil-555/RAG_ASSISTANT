Tags: Memory, Conversation, Context, User Experience


        This research investigates the role of conversational memory in RAG systems and its impact on user experience. We propose a novel memory architecture that maintains context across multiple conversation turns.

        Key Findings:
        - Contextual memory improves user satisfaction by 35%
        - Memory decay functions enhance conversation flow
        - Adaptive memory sizing optimizes performance

        Methodology:
        We developed a sliding window memory system with attention-based context selection. The system was evaluated on 500 multi-turn conversations with human evaluators.

        Limitations:
        - Memory size affects response time
        - Context selection can be computationally expensive
        - Requires careful tuning of decay parameters

        Tools and Models Used:
        - LSTM for sequence modeling
        - Attention mechanism for context selection
        - Custom decay functions
