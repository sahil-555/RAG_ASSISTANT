Author: Dr. James Wilson
Tags: Enterprise, Real-time, Scalability, Security


        This study examines the implementation of real-time RAG systems in enterprise environments, focusing on scalability, security, and integration challenges. We present a framework for deploying production-ready RAG systems.

        Key Findings:
        - Real-time processing reduces response latency by 60%
        - Enterprise-grade security features are essential
        - API integration simplifies deployment and maintenance

        Methodology:
        We developed a microservices-based architecture with real-time document indexing and secure API endpoints. The system was deployed in three enterprise environments with 1000+ concurrent users.

        Limitations:
        - Higher infrastructure costs
        - Requires dedicated DevOps resources
        - Complex monitoring and alerting setup

        Tools and Models Used:
        - Docker containers
        - Kubernetes orchestration
        - Redis for caching
        - JWT authentication
