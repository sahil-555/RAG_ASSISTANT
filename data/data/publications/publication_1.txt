        This publication explores the development of advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems that incorporate multi-modal retrieval capabilities. The research demonstrates how combining text, image, and structured data retrieval can significantly improve the quality of AI-generated responses.

        Key Findings:
        - Multi-modal retrieval improves response accuracy by 23%
        - Hybrid search strategies outperform single-modal approaches
        - Context-aware retrieval reduces hallucination by 15%

        Methodology:
        The study employed a transformer-based architecture with attention mechanisms for cross-modal alignment. We used a dataset of 10,000 multi-modal documents and evaluated performance using BLEU, ROUGE, and human assessment metrics.

        Limitations:
        - Requires significant computational resources
        - Limited to English language content
        - Training data may contain biases

        Tools and Models Used:
        - BERT for text encoding
        - Vision Transformer for image processing
        - Custom attention mechanism for cross-modal fusion
