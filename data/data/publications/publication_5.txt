Title: Evaluating RAG System Performance: A Comprehensive Framework
Author: Dr. Lisa Thompson
Tags: Evaluation, Metrics, Performance, Framework


        This publication introduces a comprehensive framework for evaluating RAG system performance across multiple dimensions. We propose standardized metrics and evaluation protocols for the RAG community.

        Key Findings:
        - Multi-dimensional evaluation provides better insights
        - Human evaluation remains crucial for quality assessment
        - Automated metrics correlate well with human judgment

        Methodology:
        We developed evaluation metrics covering retrieval accuracy, response quality, relevance, and user satisfaction. The framework was tested on 50 different RAG implementations.

        Limitations:
        - Evaluation can be time-consuming
        - Some metrics require human annotators
        - Results may vary across domains

        Tools and Models Used:
        - BLEU and ROUGE metrics
        - Custom relevance scoring
        - Human evaluation platform
