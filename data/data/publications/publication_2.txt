        This paper presents novel approaches to managing vector databases for large-scale RAG applications. We introduce a hierarchical indexing structure that reduces search time by 40% while maintaining retrieval quality.

        Key Findings:
        - Hierarchical indexing improves search efficiency
        - Adaptive clustering reduces memory usage by 30%
        - Dynamic rebalancing maintains performance under load

        Methodology:
        We implemented a hierarchical HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) graph with adaptive clustering. The system was tested on a corpus of 1 million documents with real-time query processing.

        Limitations:
        - Initial setup complexity
        - Requires periodic rebalancing
        - Memory overhead for small datasets

        Tools and Models Used:
        - HNSW algorithm
        - K-means clustering
        - Custom rebalancing algorithm
