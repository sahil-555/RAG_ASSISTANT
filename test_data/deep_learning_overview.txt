Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple 
            layers to model and understand complex patterns. It's particularly effective for 
            tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition.
            
            Deep learning models require large amounts of data and computational power, but 
            they can achieve state-of-the-art results on many tasks.
